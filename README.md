# Rekt cloud

Base on the comprehensive report from osec, we write a POC against a made up program

The rekt cloud program is a naive program which allow storage of arbitrary data, the 32 bytes being reserve to the authority, the account who controls the storage for write and resize.

It makes it a perfect candidate to try to temper


Somehow it has to run test like this `BPF_OUT_DIR=$(pwd)/target/deploy cargo test-bpf -- --nocapture` otherwise it loads the native runtime which 0% works
